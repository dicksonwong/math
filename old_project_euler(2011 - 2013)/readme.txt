This is a collection of solutions to some of the problems that I solved between 2011 and 2013.

Being rather inexperienced back then, I have not sorted or documented the code in this folder that well.  
Moreover, a large collection of solutions that I have solved were lost due to harddrive failure, so what is left is merely an old checklist.

As such, this folder is for personal reflection and archive purposes; I will also break solutions to each problem into individual problems and aggregate common algorithms used into a single file.
